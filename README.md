# FilmEngine
## Challenge description
TrueFilm is a film investment company - they fund new projects, with the goal of taking a share of any profits. In the past, these decisions were made on gut feeling, but as the industry becomes more and more competitive they  would like to become more data driven. They believe that by understanding which films have performed well in the past, they can make better decisions.

## Approach
In order to aid TrueFilm with their decision making process we'll need to source relevant data, model it and extract value out of it. For this exercise we'll be creating an *engine* that consists of various modules to help us make this happen. To understand the process let's discuss the task on hand in three sections; **What** the steps should be, **how** we execute these and **why** we'll be doing it in this manner.
